# Fine-Tuning Analysis: DistilBERT on Healthcare Dataset

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the results obtained from fine-tuning a DistilBERT model on a healthcare dataset for a text classification task.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Fine-Tuned Model:
- **Evaluation Loss:** `1.0997`
- **Evaluation Accuracy:** `32.43%`
- **Runtime:** `19.21 seconds`
- **Samples per Second:** `57.79`
- **Steps per Second:** `7.24`

### General-purpose Model:
- **Evaluation Loss:** `1.1021`
- **Evaluation Accuracy:** `33.78%`
- **Runtime:** `19.90 seconds`
- **Samples per Second:** `55.78`
- **Steps per Second:** `6.99`

## Key Observations

- **Fine-tuned Model vs. General-purpose Model:**
  - The fine-tuned model shows a slightly lower evaluation loss compared to the general-purpose model, indicating that fine-tuning had some positive impact on reducing the loss. However, the difference is marginal.
  - The evaluation accuracy of the fine-tuned model is slightly lower than that of the general-purpose model (32.43% vs. 33.78%). This suggests that the fine-tuning process might not have been very effective in this case, possibly due to the complexity of the task or insufficient data.
  - Both models have similar runtime and throughput, meaning that their performance in terms of processing speed is comparable.

## Potential Reasons for the Results

- The classification task might be challenging given the complexity of the data and the simplicity of the DistilBERT model.
- The dataset size used for fine-tuning might have been insufficient to significantly improve performance.
- The label distribution or the quality of the labels in the dataset could be impacting the modelâ€™s ability to learn effectively.
- More epochs or a different learning rate might be necessary to achieve better results.

## Next Steps

- **Data Augmentation:** Explore techniques like oversampling or adding more data to improve model learning.
- **Longer Fine-tuning:** Increase the number of epochs to allow the model more time to learn.
- **Model Exploration:** Consider trying a more complex model like BERT or exploring hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
- **Further Analysis:** Investigate the label distribution and possibly refine the dataset to improve learning outcomes.

## Conclusion

The current fine-tuning process provided a modest improvement in evaluation loss but did not significantly impact accuracy. Further exploration and adjustments are necessary to optimize performance on this classification task.
